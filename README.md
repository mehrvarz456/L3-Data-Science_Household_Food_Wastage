# L3 Data Science Course Project

This repository contains all project files for the Level 3 Data Science Course, including data, Python scripts, output files, visualizations, and documentation.

## Learning Outcomes

The course and the accompanying data analysis project significantly strengthened my understanding and practical skills in data science. In particular, I developed hands-on experience in the following key areas:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of both categorical and numerical features  
- **Feature Engineering**, including creating and selecting meaningful input variables  
- **Data Standardization and Normalization** to prepare data for machine learning  
- **Data Visualization** to communicate insights effectively using charts and graphs  
- **Machine Learning Modelling** using various algorithms suited to the dataset  
- **Model Evaluation** to assess accuracy, performance, and business relevance  

This project provided a comprehensive, end-to-end experience of the data science workflow, helping me apply theoretical concepts in a practical and meaningful way.
